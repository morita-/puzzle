# Google Play Plugins for Unity

## Overview

The Google Play Plugins for Unity provide C# APIs for accessing various Play
services at runtime from within the Unity Engine. These plugins also provide
various Unity Editor features for building an app that can be published on
[Google Play Console](//play.google.com/console).

## Version support

These plugins support Unity 2018.4 or later, as well as Unity 2017.4.40.

Note: some features depending on async tasks are only available on Unity 2018.4
or later.

Support for older versions of Unity (including 5.6) was removed after
[version 1.4.0](//github.com/google/play-unity-plugins/releases/tag/v1.4.0)
because [Google Play requires that apps published with 32 bit native libraries
also provide 64 bit native
libaries.](//android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/01/get-your-apps-ready-for-64-bit.html)

## Downloading the plugins

There are 3 different options for obtaining the plugins:

*   Download individual plugins as `.unitypackage` files or Unity Package
    Manager (`.tgz`) files from
    [Google APIs for Unity](//developers.google.com/unity)

*   Download the latest release from this project's
    [releases page](//github.com/google/play-unity-plugins/releases)

*   `git clone` this repository into the **Assets** folder of your Unity project
